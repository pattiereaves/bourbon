Find the best way to follow the Kentucky Bourbon trail based on your personal tastes.


Algorithm
========

Every bourbon has an aroma, body and finish profile (these can be fruit, spice, wood, grain and sweet â€” see http://www.kybourbon.com/index.php/how_to_taste/).

Users are given an excellent Kentucky Bourboun to try at random. From there they can vote yes, no or skip. If they vote "yes", an implicit check is given for that flavor in that profile (e.g. fruit aroma, spice body and wood finish). It takes two approvals of a bourbon of a certain style to give that flavor an "explicit" yes. 

Likewise, if they vote no, an implicity check is given against that flavor in that profile. It takes two disapprovals of a bourbon of a certain style to give that flavor an "explicit" no.

For example: Voting against a bourbon with a fruity aroma, spice body and wood finish and then voting against a bourbon with a fruity aroma, wood body and sweet finish would eliminate bourbons with a fruit aroma as an option completely.

In that same example, voting for bourbons with fruit aromas twice would start to show you only bourbons with fruit aromas.

It will narrow down your choices by aroma, then taste, then finish. Once it's determined your aroma profile, it will show you options to determine your taste profile and then show you options to determine your finish profile.

Votes for or against in earlier matches will count towards taste and finish.
